The eyes move backward (regressive movement) in reading to support a forward movement and to remember what has been read134. 22. The two reader types are fast and slow135. 23. Fast readers are capable of a large eye span and read more efficiently136. 24. A fast reader is always inaudible137. 25. A slow reader opts to reading audible to a disinterest of the public138. 26. An effective reading can lead to understanding139. 27. An effective reader hardly swings their head sideways or points at the text140. 28. An effective reader purposely reads to gain more knowledge, not pleasure141. 29. Effective reading can be selective, skipping units to concentrate on other units of the same text142. 30. An effective reading may involve a critical consideration of topic titles, introductions, and main points143. 31. The reader may vacate a text to search for additional points in another topic if the main points are unavailable144. 32. An effective reading may engage in gathering data from a text to discuss findings145. 33. A serious scholar is an effective reader who wants a program to pass through them146. 34. A person's mind can be fixed on information about a text that is being read147. 35. The eye moves to complement the faculties of reasoning and thinking about information148. 36. Good reading habits are predicated on a reasonable practice that students can adopt for more efficiency149. 37. A human mind can be actively involved in mental processes while reading150. 38. The eye movements can be blurred during a long reading session151. 39. The effective reading can be performed at a glance152. 40. The written text is sometimes transposed from a spoken text153. 50 CBT Questions 1.
